## Description
Serverside databases can easily store and transfer information to a webpage, as well as alter that same data. This Hamburger Maker demonstrates how javascript utilizing npm libraries can connect a serverside database to a client interface. And it's really fun too! 
      
This is just a simple exercise using prebuilt frontend with  handlebars to show how to build a site from the database up. It is not meant to solve a problem, but to practice technique and understanding of how these applications work. Perhaps if you've ever wanted to name sandwiches, but never had an opportunity, this could be a solution.
      
## Features
MySQL database, handlebars, deployed through heroku.
      
## Installation
This site can be accessed here:https://rf-burger-maker.herokuapp.com/ If downloading from git hub, install npm, then express, mysql and express-handlebars.
      
## Usage
If you want to make a Burger go to the creation form at the bottom of the page. You can eat a burger and put it on the menu. If that burger is trash, throw it away.
